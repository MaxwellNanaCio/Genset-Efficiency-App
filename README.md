# Genset-Efficiency-App

Overview
The Genset Efficiency (NGL) App is a comprehensive PowerApps solution developed to help factory plants manage and optimize their fuel usage and generator performance. This app provides a centralized platform for monitoring and analyzing plant fuel consumption, enabling plant managers to make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Key Features
Fuel Consumption Tracking: The app allows users to log and track the fuel consumption of each generator in the plant, providing a detailed view of fuel usage over time.

Performance Monitoring: The app collects and displays critical performance metrics for each generator, such as runtime, load factor, and fuel efficiency. This information helps plant managers identify underperforming units and take corrective actions.

Maintenance Scheduling: The app integrates a maintenance scheduling module, enabling users to plan and track preventive maintenance activities for the generators. This helps ensure optimal performance and extended lifespan of the equipment.

Reporting and Analytics: The app provides comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities, allowing plant managers to generate custom reports on fuel usage, generator performance, and maintenance activities. These insights help identify opportunities for improvement and support data-driven decision-making.

Inventory Management: The app includes a module for managing fuel inventory, enabling users to track stock levels, generate replenishment orders, and monitor fuel consumption patterns.

User Management: The app supports role-based access control, allowing plant managers to grant specific permissions to different user groups, ensuring data security and controlled access to sensitive information.

Benefits
The Genset Efficiency (NGL) App offers the following benefits to factory plants:

Improved Fuel Efficiency: By providing real-time visibility into fuel consumption and generator performance, the app helps plant managers identify and address inefficiencies, leading to significant cost savings.

Enhanced Equipment Maintenance: The app's maintenance scheduling module ensures that generators are serviced and maintained regularly, extending their lifespan and reducing the risk of unexpected breakdowns.

Data-Driven Decision Making: The app's reporting and analytics capabilities empower plant managers to make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information, leading to more efficient operations.

Streamlined Inventory Management: The app's fuel inventory management module helps plant managers maintain optimal stock levels, reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions and minimizing wastage.

Improved Compliance: The app's comprehensive data tracking and reporting features assist plant managers in meeting regulatory requirements and demonstrating compliance with industry standards.
